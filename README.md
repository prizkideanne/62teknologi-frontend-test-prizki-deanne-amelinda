# Yupp Web Application

Yupp Web Application. In this project I use **Yelp** API to demonstrate how to fetch the data and make a custom UI from the **Yelp** API.

## Project Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

- React.js
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM
- Axios
- Google Maps React Markers

## Getting Started

To access the Yelp API, you'll need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) by visiting the following link and requesting temporary access to the demo server: [CORS Anywhere Demo Server](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo).
